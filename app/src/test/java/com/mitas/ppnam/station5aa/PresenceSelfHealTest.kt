/**
 * A scanner restarted faster than the broker notices the old connection died (~keepalive,
 * 15s) gets its fresh retained `online` clobbered by the old connection's Last Will —
 * leaving retained presence stuck at `offline` while the scanner is connected. The app
 * subscribes to the station wildcard, so it sees its own presence topic and can heal by
 * republishing `online` — but must never do so while gracefully shutting down, because
 * disconnect() publishes retained `offline` first and the broker echoes it back before
 * the DISCONNECT completes.
